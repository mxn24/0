<h3>sand mining equipment manufacturers in south africa</h3><img src='1704857032.jpg' alt=''><p>Sand is a crucial substance used in construction and the extraction of minerals. The demand for sand has surged over the past decade, resulting in excessive mining of this valuable resource. The extraction of sand from beaches or rivers has doubled since the year 2000, mainly due to the booming construction industry. This has led to a surge in the need for sand mining equipment, particularly in countries where the demand for sand far exceeds the available supply.</p><p>South Africa is fortunate to have natural significant reserves of limestone. The limestone quarries have valuable resources which are used in the production of many products. This means this is good opportunity for employment creation. Quarries that are no longer of use can be turned into an entertainment area, where people can do ‘rock climbing’. On the other hand, these quarries are large and visible. If not managed properly, they can disfigure the local environment and cause pollution which is hazardous to the environment.</p><p>People have been extracting minerals, particularly sand, since the late 18th century in South Africa. Quarries are present in all the provinces and boost local economies. Sand plays a vital role in many materials used in construction, such as concrete, asphalt, bricks, mortar, plaster, cement, and more. In lesser amounts, sand is also used in land reclamation, shore protection, and dams. It is used in the production of glass and electronics.</p><p>Statistics South Africa (StatsSA) estimates that sand and gravel mining contributes about 0.2% to the GDP of the country.
