The manufacturing process involves carefully selecting top-quality raw gypsum, which is then processed to remove impurities and enhance its properties. The extracted gypsum is crushed into a fine powder and mixed with additives to improve its setting time, strength, and other characteristics. The resulting mixture is then shaped into boards, blocks, or other desired forms.</p><p>Gypsum manufacturers also focus on sustainable practices and environmental responsibility. They aim to minimize waste, energy consumption, and emissions by adopting eco-friendly manufacturing techniques. Many manufacturers are committed to recycling waste gypsum products and reducing their carbon footprint.
