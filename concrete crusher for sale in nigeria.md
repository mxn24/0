<h3>concrete crusher for sale in nigeria</h3><img src='1704791392.jpg' alt=''><p>A Case study of a concrete crusher for sale in Nigeria, with dimensions of 40 x 11 x 7, you can have a look at it here: https://www.rebecca-miningcrusher.com/product-category/crushing-plant/. Here are a few details about the machine:</p><p>- The machine weighs about 80 tons and its main dimensions are: length: 40 ft, width: 11 ft, and height: 7 ft.</p><p>- The crusher can handle unsorted concrete rubble and reduces it to manageable sizes ranging from 10 to 60 mm.</p><p>- The manufacturer has indicated a productivity rate of around 180-200 tons per hour. This is ideal for small to medium-sized construction projects or for contractors who are looking to process the concrete waste on-site.</p><p>One of the main advantages of the concrete crusher for sale in Nigeria is its ability to produce uniform-sized end products. While traditional crushers have a limited reduction ratio and often generate excessive fines, this concrete crusher has a 3:1 ratio and enables you to control the final product size through its adjustable jaws.</p><p>The machine is hydraulically powered by a 350 hp Caterpillar engine, which keeps the noise and emissions to a minimum. The engine is also EU Stage V emission-compliant, making it suitable for use in urban environments as well. Furthermore, the crusher is equipped with a dust suppression system, which further reduces dust and noise during operation.</p><p>In terms of maintenance, the crusher is built to be durable and robust. It has a reinforced frame construction and uses high-quality wear-resistant materials for its critical components. This ensures a long service life and reduces downtime due to wear and tear.</p><p>Apart from its primary function of crushing concrete, the machine can also be used to process other materials such as asphalt, brick, and natural stone. Its versatility makes it a valuable asset for any construction site or recycling center.</p><p>In Nigeria, where there is a growing demand for construction materials, particularly concrete, investing in a concrete crusher for sale could be a profitable venture. As more construction projects spring up across the country, the demand for concrete will continue to rise.</p><p>With the proper equipment in place, contractors can take advantage of the recycling potential of concrete and turn waste material into a valuable resource. This not only reduces the environmental impact of construction but also saves costs in terms of raw materials and landfill fees.</p><p>In conclusion, a concrete crusher for sale in Nigeria is a valuable investment for any construction company or contractor. It provides a solution to reduce costs and increase productivity by crushing concrete rubble on-site into reusable aggregate material. This, in turn, saves on transportation costs and reduces the need for new raw materials. With the right equipment and proper maintenance, a concrete crusher can last for years, providing a sustainable solution for the construction industry.</p><h3>Contact us</h3><ul><li><strong>Whatsapp:&nbsp;<a href="https://wa.me/8613661969651">+8613661969651</a></strong></li><li><a href="https://swt.shibang-china.com/?git&amp;zhl&amp;concrete crusher for sale in nigeria"><strong>Online Service(chat now)</strong></a></li></ul><h3>Related</h3><ul><li><a href='grinding size of limestone.md'>grinding size of limestone</a></li><li><a href='types of stone crusher machine list.md'>types of stone crusher machine list</a></li><li><a href='ton per hour stone crusher plant.md'>ton per hour stone crusher plant</a></li><li><a href='concrete crusher in georgia.md'>concrete crusher in georgia</a></li><li><a href='primary impact crusher.md'>primary impact crusher</a></li></ul>
